This is a reference for setting up a new Ant-based LWJGL project. When
I start a new LWJGL project I clone this repository, remove sections
of build.xml that I don't care about for that particular project, set
the project properties, and get to work.

This is actually a fork of my SampleJavaProject, so it receives
updates and improvements from that sample project. This one differs in
that it sets up LWJGL for me.

An important distinction is that I use my NativeGuide library to load
the native LWJGL libraries right out of the .jar file. That means this
project builds fully standalone LWJGL .jar files -- something you
don't see often with LWJGL.
